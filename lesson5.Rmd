![](./halloween.jpg)  


Here is a webinar I like and also a good book chapter.

[Tutorial on reading data into R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-your-data-into-r/)

[Great read on efficient data carpentry](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/data-carpentry.html)

[Efficient statistics slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/cjlortie/efficient-statistics-in-r)

<b>Halloween Hackathon</b>  
Costumes options.  
Candy provided.  
Now, we practice from start to finish including submission of the r-script or rmd you write to [turnitin.com](http://turnitin.com)  


A graduate-level dataset.
Apply your new mathemagical skills from scratch.
A single three-hour block.
As advanced as you want to be.
Fundamental principles demonstrated.
At least two fundamental statistical tests demonstrated.

<b>Practical outcomes to demonstrate </b>  
Rename some variables.
Address missing values.
Generate a simplified table/dataframe. 
Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
Produce a publication quality graphic.
Do EDA on data very broadly.
Do a single statistical address to capture main effect observed.
Annotate  

**Challenge**  
Compare Canada and USA candy sales at Halloween including population density of each country each in year in your analyses.

[USA Halloween spending](https://figshare.com/articles/USA_Halloween_spending_data/9876380)  

[World population data](https://figshare.com/articles/Human_population_density_data/9876389)    

**Marking key**    
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
hackathon <- read_csv("key_hackathon.csv")
knitr::kable(hackathon)

```
