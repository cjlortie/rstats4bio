The first six weeks of the course, i.e. **Module 1**, will cover data science & fundamental exploratory data analysis in R.  It is a brief introduction to contemporary open science, best-practice data management, and some fundamental biostatistical working tools. The primary goal is exploration of tools and approaches associated with effective, efficient, reproducible biostatistical analyses. Inspirations include [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), [rforcats](http://rforcats.net), and many, more open, online, free I can direct you to as needed. The [description](http://biology.gradstudies.yorku.ca/courses/biol-5081/) provided by the university is a useful starting point in deciding if this offering meets your specific needs.

**Learning outcomes**  
1.	Build a data model for a graduate-level dataset.  
2.	Develop a reproducible data and statistical workflow.  
3.	Design and complete intermediate-level data visualizations appropriate for a graduate-level simple dataset.  
4.	Complete fundamental exploratory data analysis on any dataset.  
5.	Appreciate the strengths and limitations of open science, data science, and evidence-based collaboration models.
